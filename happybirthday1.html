                <p id="message">Hi Sadijol<br>How are you? I hope you are doing great i really do, to be honest right now i have no idea why i am writing this now it's not like you would magicaly come to this page but if somehow you are here than welcome to the website i made for your birthday (if you remember when i made a website for your birthday but i couldn't even do that right and ended up makung it way past your birthdat sorry for that) maybe you remember it maybe you don't, i haven't made much changes just some littly style and some logic changes. Well i am not going to talk only about the website here, right now it 03:21AM it's 31st December this is the last day of the year 2025 i hope you get to spend it with the ones you love and care about the most i hope you end this year and start the next one with a smile on your face and your heart filled with happiness. I don't know what to say more i mean this will be the last year i can see your pretty face (i am sorry if you didn't want me to say that) and i don't know, you have made me happy and sad sometimes (ok not you it's not you the one that has made me sad it was my stupidity) but i (i am sorry a hundred times if you don't want to hear this) really really love your eyes i know i am stuid i know that but i just can't help myself. You know sometimes i get a little confused with you (not you you have done nothing) it's your eyes, i know i have done many bad and stupid things and i understand if you hate me for them i totaly do, the confusing thing that confuses me the most with your eyes is every single time i see into them every single time without fail i get reminded of the bad things i did in the past i get mesmorized by your eyes but at the same time i remember the past in which i may have hurted you or made you sad or mad or even angry and i hate myself for everything i have done and that has caused you harm i know there is nothing to justify my actions but i was stupid i know that and maybe you haven't forgiven me yet and maybe you never will and that's ok i understand it (i have caused you pain so it's not easy to forgive me). So to not make this any more longer in case you find and decide to translate it but get scared because it's to much (i am sorry i am sorry it's just a joke i swear it was just a joke i didn't mean it to get you mad or angry) so i am going to say "I hope you spend the last day of this year with the ones you love the most close by your side and i wish the same thing for you for 2026 and every other year that comes after that so good bye and i think we will see eachother at 5th Jauart 2026 and i don't know if you want to hear this or not but i can't wait to see you (it's not like you may really care about me but it's ok)". Good bye girl i wish you the best.</p>
