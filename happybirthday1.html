As you can see this thing looks a little messy i know i know it's my fauly i wanted to add somethings but i guess i can't even do that right. Since you may never see this thing i am going to be honest with you, first i am sorry for all the times i have made you sad, angry or even have hurted you maybe you can never forgive me but honestly that's ok i am not asking for that i just want you to know that i still regret my decisions, honestly i don't know how to describe this year but you know what, sometimes you confuse me you know sometimes i think youo still "hate" me, i deserve it and you have every right to hate me but the thing that confuses me are your eyes sometimes when i look into them i don't know how to describe it iit's just confusing to me it's not a look of hatered it's something soft and warm and i love your eyes another this is, i am terrified of loosing you i know you are not mine and never will be but i am still afraid of the day that you would go away i am talking about the end of the school year it's not far and that makes me ever scarier i am scared of never seeing you, never hearing you voice you laughter i may sound stupid right now but i am terrified of that day, it may not me a bog deal for you but for me it's very important. I am sorry if you don't want to hear this ever from me but i think i am still in love with you, i know i am sorry for saying that but honestly i still care about you and would do oeverything in my power to help you with anything. I stil love your eyes (sorry for saying it again) and i think i will say good buy now it's like 02:54AM on the day of your birthday now so see you at friday and have a good day.</div>
